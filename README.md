# MechType

MechType is a lightweight application designed to elevate your typing experience by allowing you to enjoy custom soundtracks with every keystroke. Say goodbye to the need for a dedicated mechanical keyboard with built-in sound features.

## Features

- **Customizable Soundtracks:** Import and play your preferred soundtracks as you type. Add more soundtracks from MechVibes to diversify your typing experience. Note that only soundtracks with WAV files are supported.

## Supported Formats

## Efficient Rust Tauri Framework

MechType is developed using Rust and Tauri, ensuring superior efficiency compared to Electron-based applications.
